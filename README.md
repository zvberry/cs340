# cs340 Reflection

When it comes to writing programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable, I’ve found that clear structure, comments, and consistent naming go a long way. During Project One, I built a CRUD Python module that handled all the database interactions. That really paid off in Project Two, where I reused that same module to power the dashboard without needing to rewrite any core logic. It made everything easier to debug, easier to read later on, and way more organized. Having a separate, well-structured CRUD module also means I could repurpose it for future dashboards or other projects that connect to MongoDB—just plug and play.

As a computer scientist, my approach to problems usually starts with breaking everything down into smaller pieces. For this project, I started with the requirements from Grazioso Salvare, made sure I understood the functionality the dashboard needed, and then worked backwards to figure out how the data should be stored and accessed. Compared to earlier projects, this one pushed me to think more like a developer working for a real client—it wasn’t just about writing code that works, it was about making something that’s clean, scalable, and easy for others to understand and use. Moving forward, I’d continue using modular design, keep documentation in mind early on, and maybe even sketch out mock interfaces first before coding.

In general, computer scientists solve real-world problems with logic, code, and systems that make things more efficient. This project was a good example, by building a dashboard that visualizes and interacts with real company data, I created a tool that could actually help a company like Grazioso Salvare make faster, better decisions. Whether it's tracking dog training units or managing resources, these kinds of systems save time, reduce errors, and improve workflows. That’s what makes this work valuable.
